## Documentation

Follow the steps to deploy this project. First, we must have all of the stock information in the shop. After that, we must generate a login ID and password.

* Run the login page.py file to create login details.
* Then run the project.py file to access the GUI for the billing system.

We've also built a database to record all of the stock information. In addition, we save the customer's details as well as their purchase in a CSV file.
